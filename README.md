This project is an example of an online activity/lesson written in javascript. This web app is a chess game with all of its legal moves coded. The code is a modified version of chess.js from Jeff Hlywa and and the board is modified from Chris Oakman (chessboard.js) Each player's goal is to get at least one of their pawns to the other side of the board.
